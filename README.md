## !!! Add sample video to sample unity project
We have had problems with putting in a 3D video onto unity, so we would like some guidance as to how to do that.

## 1. Sign to pop up 

Once the user puts on the headset and enters the coffee shop, there is a window that pops up. The window has a description of the project. **We have this written out, we just need to put it on the document** After the user reads whatever is in the window, there is a button on the bottom that says "OK". When they click on this button, the window goes away, and the user is in the room. 

## 2. Button that activates the video

In the coffee shop room there needs to be a button near to the user that has a play symbol on it. Floating above the button is text that says "click me" with an arrow pointing to the button. When the user clicks on the button, it will redirect them to the video. However, before the video is played, a window, similar to the one above, is shown. The window will have this content: 

"We would like to add that this material may be sensitive to some viewers. If at any point you would like to exit, there will be a button on top of your head. Just look up, point your controller at it, and pull the trigger to be removed from the experience."

There are two buttons on the screen in which the user may point their controller at, and press any button to select. One button is a "Cancel" in which the video will not play, the window will close, and the user will see the coffee shop. If the user clicks "Continue", the screen will fade to black, and the 3D video will begin to play. 

This task also requires importing the video into unity. The video was shot on a 3D RICOH THETA camera, and the user should be able to look around, in VR at what is happening in the video. 

## 3. Emergency Exit Button

As mentioned above, we have defined a red "Emergency Exit Button", in which the user will look up, point the controller at the button, and click any button on their controller to be returned to the coffee shop.

## 4. Pop-up window after video is finished 

After the video is finished, another window should pop up. This should also have two options. At the top of the window there needs to be text that says "The reenactment has ended." Underneath this line of text there needs to be two rounded rectangular buttons (FIND SCREENSHOT TO ATTACH/REFERENCE HERE). The button on the bottom left will say "Watch again", and the button on the bottom right will say "Continue to next incident". When the use clicks "Watch again." the screen will fade black and the video will play from the beginning. When the user clicks "Continue to next incident." the screen will fade black and the user will be transported to the 'second room'.

## 5. Button that activates video in the second room

Use the same button script from above but in the second room.

## 6. Motion Capture

Add motion capture to user while in the coffee room and 'second room'.
